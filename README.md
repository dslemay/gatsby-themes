# Gatsby Themes - Daniel Lemay

Gatsby themes provide a means to package reusable configuration, styles, and pages into a publishable package. They are installed as a dependency of the Gatsby site where they can then be extended in the Gatsby config.

Gatsby Themes are currently under an experimental flag. For examples on how to use a given theme, please check that package's README.
