## Gatsby Sample site

This site is a basic sample site scaffolding with the default Gatsby starter. It serves to assist with testing the development of themes in the repo. It is not meant to be published.

The site uses a `*` semver selector for whichever theme it is testing. Yarn workspaces allow it to specify local packages as dependencies without them being published. To check the workspace dependencies run `yarn workspaces info`.

To start the site run `yarn develop`.
